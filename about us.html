        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>Scenic Scents was founded with a commitment to building a socially and environmentally responsible company.
            Our core values include:
            <br> 1. PROVIDING HIGH-QUALITY, BUT ACCESSIBLE PRODUCTS
            <br> Unlike the mass-produced and highly synthetic perfumes that are widely available, Scenic scents fragrances are
            made in a boutique perfumery that focuses on high-quality, handcrafted manufacturing. With great attention
            to detail and creativity, we use high-quality and primarily natural ingredients that are carefully blended
            and matured in small batches. Additionally, all of our products are hand-poured and bottled.
            Various fragrances are offered in an assortment of products and sizes with a range of price points that
            ensures people of all ages and incomes will be able to join in on the Scenic Scents experience.

            <br> 2. ENCOURAGING SUSTAINABILITY
            <br> Scenic Scents is committed to sustainability by encouraging re-use and recycling of the product packaging as
            well as using environmentally safe and natural materials for the products.

            For example:
            *The fragrances are formulated with essential oils in a base of organic perfumerâ€™s alcohol made from organic
            corn. Phthalate-free fragrance oils are added to make the perfumes and organic beeswax and pure soy wax are
            added to create the candles.
            *The candles are made with cotton and paper wicks.
            *No paraffin, synthetic colors or dyes are used in the products.
            *The candle glass can be reused by cleaning it with soap and water and we use removable labels to make it
            easy to do so. Customers are encouraged to turn them into drinking glasses or containers for things such as
            pens, paper clips or cotton balls. To further encourage re-use, Scenic Scents created a signature
            cocktail/mocktail recipe incorporating some of the natural citrus ingredients featured in the fragrances to
            be enjoyed in the cleaned out tumbler.

            <br>3. CRUELTY-FREE PRODUCTS
            <br>  All Scenic Scents products are cruelty-free. No animal scents or animal by-products are used (with the
            exception of beeswax for the candles). Products are not tested on animals nor are any ingredients purchased
            from suppliers that test on animals.

            <br>4. SUPPORTING WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES

            <br> Throughout the development process and continuing in the future, Scenic Scents is dedicated to partner and
            collaborate with women and women-owned businesses whenever possible. Thus far, Scenic Scents has contracted
            with an assortment of women-owned businesses for services including manufacturing, graphic design, branding
            and public relations.

            We love our vendors & partners and highly recommend them if you need any of their services: Companies We
            Love

            <br>5. GIVING BACK :
            <br> Scenic Scents will donate 10% of its annual profits to select charitable foundations.
        </p>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
